# Palindrome_Number

This is a algo problem on leetcode.

### Problem statement : 
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

### Restrictions :
1. Not allowed to use strings (because of extra non-constant space)
2. Reversing the number not allowed because if the reversed number is larger than {int.MAX}int.MAX, we will hit integer overflow problem. (For languages have the max integer limit unlike python)
